# Aerial Cactus Identification
### Yoo Na Cha, Jordan Manchev, Nupur Neti, Michael Schweizer

## Project Description

The purpose of the project was to apply what we've learned on image recognition in a more realistic situation and explore different kinds of approches we can take and compare the results. 

In regards, we chose the 'Aerial Cactus Identification' (https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification), where we were to identify a specific type of cactus from different aerial imageries. 

### Dataset

The dataset contains 17500 aerial images of a certain type of cactus. The image files were already unified in size, which made it more convenient in terms of image preprocessing. 

## Approaches

In order to explore different approaches and packages offered for image recognition, we've made multiple submission to Kaggle Competition using different methods. 

The approaches that we've taken are as follows:

| Contents |
|---|
| [Section 00: Data Extraction and Preparation](0-data-extraction-and-preparation) |
| [Section 01: Keras and Tensorflow](1-keras-and-tensorflow) |
| [Section 02: PyTorch](2-pytorch) |
| [Section 03: Transfer Learning Model](3-transfer-learning-model) |



Through tackling the same project with different approaches, we were able to compare the advantages and disadvantages of each of the approaches such as the total time required for running the model, different options we can set for each of the methods. This in conclusion, allowed us to better understand what approaches we should be taking for other neural network projects in the future according to the different project conditions and requirements. 

## Results

For all of the differnt approaches made, the results were as follows:

## Conclusion

Comparing the different methods 

## Further Explorations

Any questions or even uncertainties that we had throughout the project
